# Linear Regression Analysis Notebook

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook, `LinearRegressionFinalOne.ipynb`, demonstrates the implementation and analysis of linear regression. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualizations to interpret results effectively.

## Features
**Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, scaling, and splitting data.  
**Linear Regression Model**: Builds and trains a linear regression model with detailed explanations.  
**Model Evaluation**: Assesses performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).  
**Visualizations**: Provides scatter plots, regression lines, and residual plots.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher  
Jupyter Notebook environment  
Required libraries: NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn

## How to Use
Download the notebook and open it in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.  
Follow the cells sequentially to execute the workflow.  
Modify the code for experimentation with different datasets or parameters.

## Customization
Replace the dataset with your own by updating the data loading cell.  
Adjust hyperparameters or evaluation metrics as needed.  
Extend the notebook to include advanced regression techniques or feature engineering.
